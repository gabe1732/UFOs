# UFOs


## Overview of the UFO sighitng webpage
the purpose of this weeks project was to setup an easy to use website that user can go and easily search for UFO sighting by date, city, state etc.  

## Results 
The website is dynamic by allowing the users to filter the data instanly and having the results display as you are filtering the information.

## Summary
In conlusion this is a good starting point for a UFO website database but I think something that would be cool to add would be a section where user can add their own sightings
